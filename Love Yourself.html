Verse
         C                   G/B              Am
For all the times that you rain on my parade
                     Dm                     C           G/B
And all the clubs you get in using my name
                           C                        G/B          Am
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
                        Dm                 C            G/B
You think I’m crying, on my own, well I ain’t
                                  C            G/B                              Am
And I didn’t wanna write a song cause I didn’t want anyone thinking I still care
    Dm          C                      G/B
I don’t but, you still hit my phone up
                          C           G/B                     Am
And baby I’ll be movin’ on and I think you should be somethin’
                        Dm          C                            G/B
I don’t wanna hold back, maybe you should know that


Pre-Chorus
                          Am                 F                    C
My mama don’t like you and she likes everyone
                    Am     F                       C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
              Am             F                     C                         G
And I’ve been so caught up in my job, didn’t see what’s going on
                  Am  F               G
And now I know, I’m better sleeping on my own


Chorus
                       C          G          Am            F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
                 C                          G          C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                  C            G          Am       F
And if you think that I’m still holdin’ on to somethin’
C                               G         C
You should go and love yourself

Verse 2
                       C                        G/B          Am
But when you told me that you hated my friends
                Dm                      C                  G/B
The only problem was with you and not them
                  C                  G/B                  Am
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
                    Dm                     C                  G/B
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                                  C            G/B                            Am
And I didn’t wanna write a song cause I didn’t want anyone thinking I still care
  Dm            C                    G/B
I don’t but, you still hit my phone up
                          C           G/B                    Am
And baby I’ll be movin’ on and I think you should be somethin’
                       Dm            C                          G/B
I don’t wanna hold back, maybe you should know that


Pre-Chorus
                          Am                 F                    C
My mama don’t like you and she likes everyone
                    Am     F                       C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
              Am             F                     C                         G
And I’ve been so caught up in my job, didn’t see what’s going on
                  Am  F               G
And now I know, I’m better sleeping on my own


Chorus
                       C          G          Am            F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
                 C                          G          C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                  C            G          Am       F
And if you think that I’m still holdin’ on to somethin’
C                               G         C
You should go and love yourself

Verse 3
                 C                      G/B                Am
For all the times that you made me feel small
            Dm                   C            G/B
I fell in love, now I feel nothin’ at all
            C                       G/B              Am
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
             Dm                 C                       G/B
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?


Chorus
                       C          G          Am            F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
                 C                          G          C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                  C            G          Am       F
And if you think that I’m still holdin’ on to somethin’
C                               G         C
You should go and love yourself

                   C          G          Am            F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
                 C                          G          C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
                  C            G          Am       F
And if you think that I’m still holdin’ on to somethin’
C                               G         C
You should go and love yourself
